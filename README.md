# NJU-DLCA-Lab1-6

I admit that it is indeed very time-consuming, but...
I believe these six labs are the most important part of the course. Building a CPU from scratch is crucial for understanding the underlying logic of a CPU.

## I have accomplished all six labs on my own, reviewed all the files and ensured their correctness, simplicity and readability,

so I am publishing them,
hoping to provide a reference for all students and to encourage discussion && mutual improvement.
